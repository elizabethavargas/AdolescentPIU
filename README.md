# AdolescentPIU
Problematic Internet Use (PIU) in adolescents poses risks to mental health, academic performance, and overall well-being. This project utilizes the Healthy Brain Network (HBN) dataset with accelerometer and tabular health data to predict PIU severity using Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, Random Forest, LightGBM, and CatBoost models. Metrics such as Cohenâ€™s Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and accuracy were used to assess model performance. Preprocessing involved handling missing values, feature engineering, scaling, and removing non-impactful variables. It was found that CatBoost outperformed other models, highlighting the potential of machine learning in predicting PIU severity and providing a foundation for data-driven early intervention strategies to protect adolescents.
